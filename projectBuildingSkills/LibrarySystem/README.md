# Library System

##### Many libraries have a library system

- Helps adding books and searching for them (id, name, quantity).
- Maintains information about the borrowed books.
- Searching for a book by name or by prefix.
- Listing books (sorted by id or by name).
- Listing users borrowed a book.
- Add a user.
- User operation: Borrow a book, return a book.

##### We will create a simple version of this classical systems

##### The main user for the system is an admin

- Who might add a book, user or perform some relevant operation
- You donâ€™t need to provide login/logout functionalities in this console system

##### The system starts with a menu

- It shows all possible choices.
- The admin selects a choice.(Some operation is performed)
- Then the main menu is listed again.
